# Randomized-meldable-heap
A randomized meldable heap (also Meldable Heap or Randomized Meldable Priority Queue) is defined as a priority queue based data structure in which the underlying structure is also a heap-ordered binary tree. However, there are no hard and fast rules on the shape of the underlying binary tree.

# FUNCTIONS :
->MakeQueue returns an empty priority queue
->FindMin(Q) returns the minimum item from priority queue Q.
->DeleteMin(Q) deletes and returns the minimum item from priority queue Q.
->Insert(Q; e) inserts item e into priority queue Q.
->Meld(Q1; Q2) returns the priority queue formed by combining disjoint priority queues Q1 and Q2.
